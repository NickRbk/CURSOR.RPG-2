I tried to make it so that it was easy to add a new race and a parameter.
Now there are 3 races and 2 specialities.

### Good â€˜ol RPG
We must fight against monsters in the Labyrinth.
For doing this we need a team of three characters, one of them is a leader.
In case of a leader's death or if we find special item "the Great Crystal", the game will end.
The team can be compiled from the characters of three races: Elf, Human, Dwarf.
Each race have a specialities which have treir own advantages.
