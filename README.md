### Good â€˜ol RPG
We must fighting against monsters in Labyrint.
For do this we have to take a team of three characters, one of them is a leader.
In the event of a leader's death or if we find item the Great Crystall  - the game will end.
The team can be compiled from the characters of three races: Elf, Human, Dwarf.
